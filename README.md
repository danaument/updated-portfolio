### <a name="Description">Description:</a>
This project is a complete redesign of my portfolio as a homework assignment submission for the ninth week of UT's web dev coding bootcamp.  It contains a codebase and a deployed webpage for my portfolio to date.

### <a name="Notes">Notes from Dan:  </a>
A portfolio should reflect its owner, and I am fairly happy with how this page has turned out.  I used the Bulma CSS framework and challenged myself to learn and utilise SASS (compiled via live SASS VSCode extension).  I had some difficulty working with Bulma's SASS variables.  They seem to have recently restructured how they implement them, and the documentation is a bit thin.  

I look forward to continuing to update this portfolio with new selected projects, uniformly-sized images, a contact form, etc.

### <a name="Credits">Credits: </a>
